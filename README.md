## Features

### Notifications

When a shiny or legendary Pokémon spawns in the world, a system message is sent to all players on the server with information about the spawn.

### PLA Shiny Sound

When a shiny Pokémon spawns in the world or is sent out by a player, the Pokémon Legends: Arceus shiny sound plays.

### Config Options

In the config, you can choose what kind of information you would like to show in the system messages sent by the mod. You can mix and match between showing coordinates and biome. You can also choose to hide messages about shiny Pokémon and/or legendary Pokémon. You can also choose to turn off the PLA shiny sound for player-owned Pokémon.
